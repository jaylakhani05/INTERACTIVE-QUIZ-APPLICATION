Throughout the CODTECH Data Analysis Internship, I had the opportunity to work on four well-structured and practical tasks that encompassed the fundamental domains of modern data analysis. These tasks included Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, Data Visualization, and Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each task allowed me to gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets and apply essential Python libraries and data science tools to derive meaningful insights and solutions.

In Task 1 focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where the main goal was to understand the dataset's structure and identify patterns, trends, and potential anomalies. I began by importing and exploring the dataset using the pandas library to examine column names, data types, and statistical summaries using .info() and .describe() functions. I also used matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the data through bar plots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps. These visual tools helped reveal the relationships between variables, frequency distributions, and potential outliers. The EDA process set the foundation for all subsequent tasks by enabling me to understand what kind of data I was working with and how it could be used to extract insights.
